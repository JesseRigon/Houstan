# Quick start guide for Docker Compose

This option will stand up the provisioner using Docker Compose.
You will need to bring your own machines to provision.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed (version >= 19.03)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed (version >= 2.10.2)

## Steps

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tinkerbell/sandbox.git
   cd sandbox
   ```

2. Set the public IP address for the provisioner

   ```bash
   # This should be an IP that's on an interface where you will be provisioning machines
   export TINKERBELL_HOST_IP=192.168.2.111
   ```

3. Set the IP and MAC address of the machine you want to provision (if you want Tink hardware, template, and workflow records auto-generated)

   ```bash
   # This IP and MAC of the machine to be provisioned
   # The IP should normally be in the same network as the IP used for the provisioner
   export TINKERBELL_CLIENT_IP=192.168.2.211
   export TINKERBELL_CLIENT_MAC=08:00:27:9E:F5:3A
   ```

   > Modify the [hardware.yaml](../../deploy/stack/compose/manifests/hardware.yaml), as needed, for your machine.

4. Start the provisioner

   ```bash
   cd deploy/stack/compose
   docker compose up -d
   # This process will take about 5-10 minutes depending on your internet connection.
   # Hook (OSIE) is about 400MB in size and the Ubuntu Focal image is about 500MB
   ```

5. Power up the machine to be provisioned

6. Watch for the provisioner to complete

   ```bash
   # watch for the workflow to completion
   # once the workflow is complete (see the expected output below for completion), move on to the next step
   KUBECONFIG=./state/kube/kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get -n tink-system workflow sandbox-workflow --watch
   ```

7. Reboot the machine

8. Login to the machine

   The machine has been provisioned with Ubuntu Focal.
   You can now SSH into the machine.

   ```bash
   # crtl-c to exit the watch
   ssh tink@${TINKERBELL_CLIENT_IP} # user/pass => tink/tink
   ```
